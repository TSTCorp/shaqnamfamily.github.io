				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Avigilon Control Center (ACC) is an easy to use video management software, and has optimized how security professionals manage and interact with high definition video. As a distributed network platform with enterprise-class reliability, Avigilon Control Center is able to efficiently capture, manage and store high definition surveillance video while intelligently managing bandwidth and storage. Avigilon Control Center can be pre-installed and configured on an Avigilon High Definition Video Appliance, Network Video Recorder (NVR) with   the industry’s highest NVR network throughput or work as stand-alone software, to meet the needs of a wide variety of installations.</p>
<p>Avigilon Control Center records and manages both video and audio from the Avigilon<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> line of megapixel cameras (from 1 – 5 MP and 4</p>
<p>– 7K based on horizontal resolution). ACC can seamlessly integrate with conventional analog cameras, along with a broad range of third- party IP cameras and encoders, giving you the ability to build a hybrid system – providing you with a budget-conscious migration from analog to digital. ACC software’s easy-to-use interface allows personnel to evaluate and respond to events with minimal training.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Avigilon Control Center uses our patented HDSM<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> software technology to efficiently compress and preserve image quality while intelligently managing HD image transmission throughout the Avigilon system — sending only the requested portions of captured images</p>
<p>to operator workstations. This technology delivers exceptional image quality while providing immediate savings in transmission bandwidth  allowing  operators to use less powerful workstations and thereby reducing</p>
<p>costs. Our HDSM technology leverages leading imaging, hardware, data compression and information technologies to maximize performance of the Avigilon system.</p>
